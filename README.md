# PRIR_Homework_GoogleColab_PyTorch
In this work, I would like to find PyTorch applications that are related to my interests.\
I think I did it. c:
### Task 1) PyTorch implementation of AnimeGANv2
Since childhood, I have been interested in Japanese culture.\
My first acquaintance with Japan began with my first animated cartoon - "Howl's Moving Castle" by Hayao Miyazaki.\
And this wonderful piece of art was enough to draw me into the world of Japanese culture.\
Therefore, in this task, I wanted to find something related to anime.\
And I found it - ```code, that turning portraits of people into stylized anime images.```\
This is a kind of filter-transformation into an anime character. \
In this implementation, there was already a ready-made code, which I tested and received the following results.\
```Anime_Facegan.ipynb``` - the file with the code ready for testing.
#### My results:
##### Hayao Miyazaki

### Task 2) Open-Unmix PyTorch
As much as anime, I also love music.\
So much so that I can't part with the headphones for a long time.\
Therefore, in the second case, I was looking for something interesting related to music.\
```Open-Unmix``` is a deep neural network reference implementation for music source separation.\
Allow users to separate pop music into four stems: vocals, drums, bass and the remaining other instruments.\
Using this code, you can not only separate ordinary music, but also music from video.
#### Code
The results can be seen in this link.
The file ```.ipynb``` is big so I decided to make a link available: (github allows to attach files up to 25 MB in size)

## Conclusion
Of course, the PyTorch library has many uses, but I wanted to show you the most interesting from my point of view.\
```Anime Fiter - AnimeGANv2``` can be very interesting for all ages, which can be a nice addition to an application related to photo modification.\
```Separator Open-Unmix``` will be useful for creating music and for people who are beginners in their adventure with music.
