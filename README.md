# PRIR_Homework_GoogleColab_PyTorch
In this work, I would like to find PyTorch applications that are related to my interests.\
I think I did it. c:
### Task 1) PyTorch implementation of AnimeGANv2
Since childhood, I have been interested in Japanese culture.\
My first acquaintance with Japan began with my first animated cartoon - "Howl's Moving Castle" by Hayao Miyazaki.\
And this wonderful piece of art was enough to draw me into the world of Japanese culture.\
Therefore, in this task, I wanted to find something related to anime.\
And I found it - ```code, that turning portraits of people into stylized anime images.```\
This is a kind of filter-transformation into an anime character. \
In this implementation, there was already a ready-made code, which I tested and received the following results.\
```Anime_Facegan.ipynb``` - the file with the code ready for testing.
#### My results:
